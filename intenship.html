<h3>BHEL– (15 Days)  On Study of Application of PLCS from CNC machines  </h3>
<section>
<p>Headquarters: New Delhi<br>
Founded: 1964<br>
BHEL is engaged in the design, engineering, manufacturing, construction, testing, commissioning and servicing of a wide range of products, systems and services for the core sectors of the economy, viz. power, transmission, industry, transportation, renewable energy, oil & gas and defense. 
It has a network of 17 manufacturing units, 2 repair units, 4 regional offices, 8 service centers, 8 overseas offices, 15 regional centers, 7 joint ventures, and infrastructure allowing it to execute more than 150 projects at sites across India and abroad. The company has established the capability to deliver 20,000 MW p.a. of power equipment to address the growing demand for power generation equipment.

About CNC machine:-<br>
Here machines are microprocessor based control systems. The machine tool is basically CNC. The CNC concept employs a mini computer for online control of the NC machine tool and eliminates as far as possible, additional hardware circuits in the control cabinet.
<br>
Advantages of CNC:<br>
 ● Increase in flexibility.<br>
 ● Reduction in hardware circuits and simplification of remaining hardware as the                 
   availability of automatic diagnostic program.<br>
 ●A reduction in inaccuracies in manufacturing due to the reduced use of tape reader.<br>
 About plcs:-
 <br> programmable logic controller (PLC) or programmable controller is an industrial digital computer which has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, or robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming and process fault diagnosis.

PLCs can range from small modular devices with tens of inputs and outputs (I/O), in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and SCADA systems.

They can be designed for many arrangements of digital and analog I/O, extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non-volatile memory.

PLCs were first developed in the automobile manufacturing industry to provide flexible, rugged and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired relays. Since then, they have been widely adopted as high-reliability automation controllers suitable for harsh environments.

A PLC is an example of a "hard" real-time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result.
