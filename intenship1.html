 WAG 7 - 7H<br>
 WAG 7 is the name of a type of electric locomotive used in India. It is the 7th class of Wide Gauge's(W) AC charged(A) and Freight-dedicated(G-Goods) locomotives. 
 Built by Chittaranjan Locomotive Works and BHEL, Jhansi to RDSO specifications. On 3 August 1992, the first WAG-7 locomotive was inaugurated and christened the name 'SHANTIDAN' in honor of Mother Teresa.
 The loco is controlled by a tap changer. Indian Railway is going to achieve 7,000,000 tonnes (6,890,000 long tons; 7,720,000 short tons) of traffic, WAG 7 is the main stay of loco. 
 In the locomotive vehicle market WAG 7 is more economical option and one of the most affordable in the world. Hence, it has the highest production figures of any locomotive in India.<br>

The first 71 of this class initially or still homed at Mughalsarai (MGS) shed and the second was Kanpur (CNB). Some units are retrofitted with Static Converters(STC) instead of Arno Rotary Converters.
 STCs are more efficient and require less maintenance. Also, STCs have self diagnostics making troubleshooting easier.
 WAG-7H is a heavy variant of WAG-7. WAG-7H #28739 has thicker under-frames. WAG-7 #27445 has closed-circuit cameras to monitor the pantograph along with a spotlight to illuminate the same at night, 
 green lamps to exchange signals and a single windscreen on either side. New Katni (NKJ) shed has added Overhead Equipment(OHE) monitors.
 Some WAG-7 units have A.C. cabs, SIV, MPFDCS, MPCS, Single arm pantograph, FDCS, Additional COC, Rear-view mirrors, STS, Daulat Ram's Roof-mounted DBRs, SI, Modified ceilings, Bucket seats, Waist-level headlamps, High-reach pantographs, Vigilance Control Device(VCD), Wireless Multiple Control, Vertical Dynamic Brake Resistor(DBR) and microprocessor control. Some units have their MU cables removed. 
 One unit has SCHUNK pantograph. Some units are assembled at Dahod Workshops.<br> Initially WAG-7 had the body-shell similar to WAG-5 but later on all WAG-7 are/were fitted with crew safe shell like the WAP-4 
 since this provided more space and relatively safer during the impact on a head-on collision. WAG-7H have crew safe shell since beginning. 
 Older WAG-7s have Tiger Face liveries (Red/Dark Blue on white) but newer WAG-7s by CLW have yellow stripe on blue livery. 
 All BHEL built WAG-7s have Tiger Face livery. Now, even some older WAG-7s are repainted with yellow stripe on blue livery.
 It is also the most powerful indigenously designed freight-dedicated locomotive in India.<br>
 Variants<br>
  The WAG-9 is a type of electric locomotive used by the Indian Railway It was the most powerful freight locomotive of its fleet until the formal induction of the WAG-12. 
  It is similar to the WAP-7 class locomotive but features a different gear ratio, which makes it suitable for heavy freight operations. 
  In November 1998, the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) started producing these with indigenous components. The first of which, named Navyug (New Era), was produced on 14 November 1998.
  Like the WAP-5 units, the WAG-9 has GTO thyristor converters and three-phase asynchronous motors.<br>

<br>Newer versions of the WAG-9 feature full Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) traction control; the debut model was the WAG-9 31248. The class as a whole is denoted by the WAG-9i prefix in its model number, although there is a technical variant of this class named WAG-9H, with the "H" meaning "Heavy".

The WAG-9H/9Hi locomotives are the second heaviest in regular service in India, the only freight-dedicated three-phase AC locomotives in the country, and the only electric locomotives in India fitted with IGBT. 
They are also the freight locomotives with the highest operational speed in India.<br>
